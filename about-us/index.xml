      <description>Members of the Executive Committee include senior persons engaged in research, development and demonstration and persons who manage those efforts. Each institution chooses its representatives according to its own needs. Members of the Executive Committee take turns serving as host to the twice yearly Executive Committee Meeting. These meetings are the venue for face-to-face discussion. In addition, the host complements these discussions by arranging presentations from national experts and/or tours of whatever facilities the host deems appropriate.</description>
