<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-align: center; font-size: 10px;"><strong>ExCo Members and Guests Meeting near Munich, Germany, May 2016<br />
</strong></span><img alt="" src="https://ieahts.org/images/IMG_0253.JPG" style="vertical-align: middle;" /><br />
<br />
</p>
<h3>Purpose and Scope</h3>
<p>The mission of the International Energy Agency&rsquo;s Technology Collaboration Program on High-Temperature Superconductivity (HTS TCP) is to evaluate the status and assess the prospects for future use of HTS by the electric power sector within the developed and developing world and to disseminate these results to decision makers in government, the private sector, and the research and development (R&amp;D) community.&nbsp;<br />
<img alt="" src="https://ieahts.org/images/iea-logo.jpg" style="float: right; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 20px;" /><br />
<br />
The HTS TCP conducts outreach directed toward the following groups of stakeholders:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>Electric utilities</em>, where decisions are made about adopting technology</li>
    <li><em>Governments</em>, where decisions are made regarding policies, subsidies, and funding for research, development, and demonstration (RD&amp;D)</li>
    <li><em>Professional engineering community</em>, to which managers must turn for advice and implementation</li>
    <li><em>RD&amp;D community</em>, where the inclination to invent and innovate and solve complex problems resides</li>
</ul>
<p>These four groups are sources of expertise that can inform the evaluations and assessments performed under the TCP. The TCP participants also recognize the importance of educating the next generation of students and young engineers and see this as part of their mission of information sharing.</p>
<p>Our unique mission has attracted worldwide interest and collaboration. This mission is particularly important now and continuing over the next decade, because HTS demonstration projects have been successfully carried out and new projects are under way in Asia, Europe, and North America. The significance of this work, with its potential of better HTS materials, conductors, products and devices, gives us much to consider at a time when governments seek impactful cost-effective RD&amp;D and the power sector is subject to changing requirements, particularly because of the public&rsquo;s desire for green power and a sustainable environment.</p>
