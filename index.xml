      <description>Superconducting wire is the fundamental technology enabling an array of innovative devices. More than 15 companies are working actively to increase the total production capacity of HTS wire. Some companies can manufacture 1000 km/year of Bi2223, YBCO and MgB2 wire. Cost of the wire is recognized as a key factor for more widespread use in electric power applications; the current cost is around a few hundred $/kilo-amp-meter (kAm) (using critical current (Ic) at 77 K and self-field) for YBCO and should be reduced to around $10/kAm in 2030 for more widespread market adoption.</description>

      <description>Encouraging the next generation of scientists and engineers to become interested in superconductivity is&amp;nbsp;critical. Students and young professionals have the potential to develop new and innovative ideas to help the technology proceed along the pathway to commercialization. To this end, the HTS TCP has been hosting a competition to nurture young researchers in this topic area since 2014.
On 17 November 2015, a Special Session at the International Symposium on Superconductivity held in Tokyo, Japan entitled Superconducting Applications and Future Energy Perspective.</description>

      <description>The HTS TCP collaborates with several other TCPs such as the International Smart Grid Action Network.&amp;nbsp; Annex 5, the Smart Grid International Research Facility Network (SIRFN) is one group in particular that the HTS TCP connects with on a regular basis. SIRFN gives participating countries the ability to evaluate pre-competitive technologies and systems approaches in a wide range of smart grid implementation use cases and geographies using common testing procedures. The HTS TCP is also active in developing products for the Program of Work for Annex 6, Power T&amp;amp;D Systems.</description>

      <description>Cables There is more than 20 years of operating hour experience with cable projects worldwide. Among all HTS applications, including non-power devices, cables have the most operational experience. When combining the operating experience of all the cables in the world, there is more than 20 years of operating hours. HTS cable projects have been energized in large scale grid demonstrations around the world ranging from approximately 10 kV&amp;mdash;275 kV. Nearly ten cable demonstration projects are under development; these include projects in the distribution voltage (10 kV&amp;mdash;66 kV) and transmission voltage (66 kV&amp;mdash;275 kV) range.</description>

      <description>1G
 First generation HTS wires, formed by extrusion of BSCCO with a metal sheath.
   2G
 Second generation HTS wires, formed by depositing YBCO onto a metal substrate.
   A/cm
 Unit of critical current, Ic, for superconducting wire per 1 cm width. Used especially for YBCO because it is a tape form and the Ic depends on its width.

      <description>There are also many other notable superconductive application areas outside of electric power sector, such as medicine, communications, industry, scientific research, transportation, and defense. Several specific examples of these applications include high-field magnets, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), magnetically levitated trains, and ship degaussing systems. These applications&amp;mdash;which today are often based on LTS&amp;mdash;demonstrate that superconductive technology can be used in a variety of applications in many sectors of the world economy.</description>

      <description>Superconductivity is a phenomenon that causes certain materials, at low temperatures, to lose all resistance to the flow of electricity. The lack of resistance enables a range of innovative technology applications. The temperature at which resistance ceases is referred to as the &amp;ldquo;transition temperature&amp;rdquo;, or critical temperature (Tc). Tc is usually measured in kelvin (K)&amp;mdash;0 K being absolute zero. HTS gets its name originally because it has a higher transition temperature (77 K, which can be achieved when using liquid nitrogen) than Low temperature superconductivity (LTS) (around 4.</description>
